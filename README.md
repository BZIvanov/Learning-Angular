# Getting started and installation

Go to Angular [setup](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local) page and follow the installation steps.

## ISSUES

- issue with VS code with experimentalDecoratos
- solution: go to File -> Preference -> Settings and add this option

```
"javascript.implicitProjectConfig.experimentalDecorators": true
```
